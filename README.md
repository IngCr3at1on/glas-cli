### Glas-CLI

[![Build Status][travis_badge]][travis]

---

A command line front end for the [Glas MUD client framework](https://github.com/IngCr3at1on/glas).

Experimental releases are compiled automatically on push, these can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/IngCr3at1on/glas-cli/releases) with the prefix 'untagged' (experimental releases should be considered unstable and are subject for removal from the releases page at any time).

Stable releases will be tagged and listed on the [releases page](https://github.com/IngCr3at1on/glas-cli/releases) when they are available.

Currently only linux and os-x builds are compiled by Travis.
